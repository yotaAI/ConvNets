# Neural Style Transfer

Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

Note : 

🏷️ I tried both Adam and L-BFGS optimzier.

🏷️Adam Optimizer is having good output after 200 epoch.

🏷️L-BFGS after 2nd iterationn style is merging on the image but The output is coming bad.
